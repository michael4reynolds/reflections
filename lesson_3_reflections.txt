When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Having a remote repository allows me to share it with others as well as having a
    backup for myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures that any changes I make local don't get overwritten by the remotes changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Clones are copies of a repository.
    Forks are clones on the server containing the repository.
    Branches are independent lines of development.

    Forks are used when you cannot directly edit a repository.
    Clones are used to be able to edit a remote repo on a local machine.
    Branches are used to explore new ideas and directions without corrupting the main repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It enable interation with the remote repository even if you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I'd probably use email as well as a good diff merge program. It would be easier in that there
    wouldn't be any commands to remember but more difficult to share and maintain order.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'd like to experiment on new ideas without contanimating to master
    branch. It's worth it even though it takes much less time to work on the master directly.
