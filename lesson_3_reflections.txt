When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Having a remote repository allows me to share it with others as well as having a
    backup for myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures that any changes I make local don't get overwritten by the remotes changes.
