When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Having a remote repository allows me to share it with others as well as having a
    backup for myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually ensures that any changes I make local don't get overwritten by the remotes changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Clones are copies of a repository.
    Forks are clones on the server containing the repository.
    Branches are independent lines of development.

    Forks are used when you cannot directly edit a repository.
    Clones are used to be able to edit a remote repo on a local machine.
    Branches are used to explore new ideas and directions without corrupting the main repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It enable interation with the remote repository even if you are offline.
